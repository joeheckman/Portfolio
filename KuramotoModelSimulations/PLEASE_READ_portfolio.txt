This folder contains experiments controlling the Kuramoto model's synchronization speed around critical oscillator coupling strengths. The figures in 'Visualization of PCF curves...' were created from the average variance in order parameter of 80 Kuramoto model simulations at different Target Frequency Gap values. 'Aligned/Unaligned' corresponds to whether the maximum variance in order parameter value (critical point) of each Kuramoto simulation were aligned before taking an average. This explains the dulled tip for the unaligned result. The variance in order parameter is a measure for criticality in an oscillator network; the oscillator systems transition between two 'phases' - desynchronized and synchronized - as the coupling strength is increased. Maximum criticality is achieved at the critical point between the two phases. 'Target Frequency Gap' is a network construction parameter that enables precise control of the transition speed in the Kuramoto Model. 

Coupled oscillator models are suspected to provide important insight into the mechanisms of hypersensitivity in pathological brain networks. A proposed explanation for some symptoms of fibromyalgia is that brain activity synchronizes more intensely and abruptly as a response to stimuli. This is being investigated by analyzing topological properties of the Kuramoto model time series and comparing it to topological properties of empirical brain electroencephalogram data. 

This folder also contains sample code I wrote that was used for tests in coupled oscillator system dynamics as the project was maturing.
