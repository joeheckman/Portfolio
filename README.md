# Portfolio
Three of the folders above contain scripts that generated results in the portfolio. The folder 'BeginSYKsimulations' is a separate project comparing two-point correlation functions and out-of-time-order correlators for the SYK model using normal and non-normal distributions of standard 4-fermion interaction coupling.
